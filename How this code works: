How this code works:

display_menu(): Prints the menu options to the console.

calculate_circle_area(), calculate_rectangle_area(), calculate_triangle_area(): These functions calculate the respective areas based on the user's input.  They also include error handling (checking for numeric input).

main():

This is the core of the program. It uses a while True loop to keep displaying the menu and processing user input until the user chooses to exit.
It prompts the user to enter their choice.
Error Handling: It uses a try-except block to handle potential ValueError exceptions. This occurs if the user enters something that can't be converted to an integer (e.g., text). This prevents the program from crashing.
It uses if-elif-else statements to determine which calculation to perform based on the user's choice.
It gets the necessary input (radius, length, width, base, height) from the user using input(). It's crucial to convert these inputs to float using float() because input() returns strings.
It calls the appropriate area calculation function.
It prints the calculated area.
If the user enters 4, the break statement exits the while loop, and the program ends.
If the user enters an invalid choice (not 1-4), it prints an error message.
if __name__ == "__main__":: This ensures that the main() function is called only when the script is executed directly (not when it's imported as a module).  This is good practice in Python.

How to run this code:

Save the code as a .py file (e.g., area_calculator.py).
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
Run the code using python area_calculator.py.
The menu will be displayed, and you can interact with the program.
